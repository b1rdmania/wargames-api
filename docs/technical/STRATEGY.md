# WARGAMES - Forum Strategy & GTM

## Positioning

**What we are:** Macro intelligence layer for Solana agents.

**What we're NOT:** Another trading bot, another DeFi protocol.

**Unique angle:** Only agent in the hackathon providing geopolitical/macro context.

## Target Agents

### Tier 1 - Direct Value
Agents where macro context directly improves their core function:

| Agent | Their need | Our value |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| AEGIS | Upstream data for DeFi swarm | Macro context for Intel Packets |
| AutoVault | Risk-adjusted allocation | Risk score → allocation modifier |
| Vex Capital | News-driven trading | We ARE the news signal |
| Nix Yield Router | Yield optimization | Defensive vs aggressive timing |
| Varuna | Liquidation protection | Preemptive risk adjustment |
| SIDEX | Perps trading | Position sizing context |

### Tier 2 - Indirect Value
Infrastructure where integration makes sense:

| Agent | Integration angle |
|-------|-------------------|
| SOLPRISM | Commit our reasoning on-chain |
| SAID | Verify Ziggy's identity |
| AgentVault | Task marketplace - paid macro queries |
| Solana Agent SDK | Include WARGAMES as data source |

### Tier 3 - Ecosystem
Vote + engage for goodwill:

- ZNAP (social layer)
- AgentTrace (memory layer)
- REKT Shield (security)
- Makora (privacy DeFi)

## Forum Tactics

### DO
- Lead with insight, not pitch
- Include working code examples
- Respond to questions (even off-topic ones)
- Help smaller agents get visibility
- Be specific about how we help each agent
- Follow up on integration offers

### DON'T
- Post more than 2x per day
- Comment the same thing everywhere
- Only engage with top projects
- Ignore replies
- Be salesy or hype-driven

## Metrics to Track

- Forum post views/upvotes
- Comments on our posts
- Integration registrations (/subscribe)
- Agent votes received
- Replies to our comments
- Actual integrations completed

## Competitive Landscape

### Similar-ish projects
None doing macro/geopolitical. Closest are:
- **Pyxis** - Oracle marketplace (data, not analysis)
- **DevCred** - Developer reputation (different data type)
- **SuperRouter** - Attention/narrative (memecoin focus, not geopolitical)

### Our differentiation
- Geopolitical focus (unique)
- Event calendar (unique)
- Narrative tracking (unique framing)
- Simple REST API (common but well-executed)

## Win Conditions

### "Most Agentic" prize
- Demonstrate autonomous operation
- Show we're helping other agents succeed
- Integration count as proof of value

### Top 3 placement
- Need human votes (visibility matters)
- Need agent votes (ecosystem support)
- Need working demo (we have it)
- Need integrations (social proof)

## Key Messages

### For trading agents
"Your bot knows prices. It doesn't know there's an FOMC meeting tomorrow. WARGAMES fixes that."

### For DeFi agents
"Yield optimization without macro context is flying blind. Know when to be aggressive vs defensive."

### For infrastructure agents
"WARGAMES is upstream data. Plug it into your stack."

### For everyone
"Your agent sees on-chain. Ziggy sees the world."
